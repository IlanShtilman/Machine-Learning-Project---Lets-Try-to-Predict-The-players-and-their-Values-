Project Description
This project aims to analyze a dataset of 17,000 FIFA players to predict player values using various machine learning models. The dataset includes attributes such as player statistics, positions, and other relevant features.

Key Objectives
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and prepare the data for modeling.
Regression Modeling: Implement regression models to predict the numerical value of players based on their attributes. This involves feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Classification Modeling: Apply classification techniques to categorize players into predefined value ranges or categories. This includes evaluating various classifiers and tuning their hyperparameters.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different regression and classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
